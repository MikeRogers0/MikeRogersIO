## Bootstrap

[Twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) has really grown on me in the last few months, while I still code front end sites with a "keep it as small as possible" approach, the efficiency gained when using bootstrap is awesome.

## PHP Frameworks

I finally started getting into using frameworks this year (Once I got my head around MVC they started clicking more & more). [Yii](http://www.yiiframework.com/) has been one of the frameworks I thought was pretty cool (mostly because you can build a site based on the database set up).

I reckon this year I'm going to move more towards [Zend](http://framework.zend.com/) & [FuelPHP](http://fuelphp.com/) (maybe [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) too).

## SASS/LESS

I've really taken to using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) in most my projects this year, though I've been using it with [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) on my Mac which feels messy. I'm looking at setting up my stack so it just complies on the server on the fly & caches on a CDN.

## Node.JS

I've played a little with Node.js, it's on my todo to use it more.

## iTunes U

I love kicking back & watching videos on my iPad. I'm going to try and make use of some of the videos on iTunes U this year.

## More Linux

I'm currently on OSX, which is nice but too many of the updates cause issues. I'm pretty tempted to make Linux Mint/Pear OS my default OS.
