title: An Introduction To Stimulus.js
description: I wrote an article for Smashing Magazine about Stimulus.js

I'm currently a pretty big fan of Stimulus.JS, it's a nice middle ground between jQuery & React.

So I'm pretty excited to share that I recently wrote [An Introduction To Stimulus.js](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/introduction-stimulusjs/) for Smashing Magazine!

It gives a nice overview of how to get started with Stimulus & a few handy code samples which should help you get going :D
