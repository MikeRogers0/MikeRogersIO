description: An OSX trick to make bluetooth devices connect faster.

If you use bluetooth mice or keyboards on OSX you may have noticed they take a little while to connect. Here is a neat little trick I found to make them connect faster.

When you have paired your device, open your Bluetooth PreferencesÂ (Either via Spotlight or via the System Preferences). Select your peripheral, than click on the cog next to the add or remove buttons and select "Add to Favourites". Bluetooth devices should now connect a little faster :)
