Basecamp just released Hotwire ( https://hotwire.dev/ ), it's a collection of libraries which make creating blazingly fast frontends really simple with Ruby on Rails.

One of the most interesting parts, is how they did partial updates with turbo-rails ( https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails ), a few lines of code & you have an app which can update in real-time!

In this tutorial I run though how to setup the new hotwire stuff, and go though how to push new content to users.
