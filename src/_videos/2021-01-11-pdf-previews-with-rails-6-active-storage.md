You can use the `.preview` method on Active Storage objects (which contain a PDF or videos) to create image previews of the content within the file.

It's really fun to use, plus it only requires a few lines of code to get setup. It does require installing Poppler (for PDF previews) and FFmpeg (for video previews) which I'll covered in the video.
