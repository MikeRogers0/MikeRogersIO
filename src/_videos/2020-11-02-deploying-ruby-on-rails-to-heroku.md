Let's deploy a Ruby on Rails Application to Heroku! I'm going to cover how to set up your application so it'll deploy every time you push to GitHub and we'll run migrations on deploy automatically.

Heroku: https://www.heroku.com/ruby
Procfile Documentation: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-support#rack-applications-process-types
Heroku Getting Started Guide: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails6
