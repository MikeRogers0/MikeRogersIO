ActionMailer::Preview is such an under utilised feature of most of the Ruby on Rails projects I've worked on. It allows you to build mailers within your browser & it comes built in.

I'm a big fan of using this feature of sending lots of emails. On your local development environment it's located http://127.0.0.1:3000/rails/mailers .
