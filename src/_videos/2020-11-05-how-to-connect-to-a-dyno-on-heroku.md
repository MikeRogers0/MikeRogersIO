When you connect to Heroku, it'll spin up a dyno for your current session. So you can run a CPU intensive task & it won't crash your web app. It also has an ephemeral file system, so any changes will not be persisted.

In this video, I'll cover the basics on how to get access to the dyno & demo the ephemeral file system.
