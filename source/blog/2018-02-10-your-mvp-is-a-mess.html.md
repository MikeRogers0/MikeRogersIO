Quite often I'm approached by small companies who have a similar story. They hired a developer to build their MVP, and the other developer suddenly disappeared weeks before they wanted to launch.

Seriously. More often then not, the codebase is an unreadable tangled mess, which looks like the whoever worked on it before hand simply rolled their face across the keyboard until one of the lines of code worked.

I totally get why people want to cut corners, but when it leads to a shitshow...it's not MVP. It's maxium terrible product. It's not validating the idea, it's only validating that they can't hire decent developers.

## How to actually build a rails MVP

You do it fucking organised.

### yarn for bootstrap

### ActiveAdmin for admining

### Simple forms - only list out the forms.

### Devise for users - don't fuck it up.

Seriously, don't fuck this shit up.
