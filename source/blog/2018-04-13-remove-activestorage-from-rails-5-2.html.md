Rails 5.2 has [landed](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2018/4/9/Rails-5-2-0-final/) and it brings some pretty cool new additions to the Rails stack.

However while upgrading one of my apps, I ran `rails routes` and noticed some new Active Storage routes had appeared:

```
       rails_service_blob GET  /rails/active_storage/blobs/:signed_id/*filename(.:format)                               active_storage/blobs#show
rails_blob_representation GET  /rails/active_storage/representations/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename(.:format) active_storage/representations#show
       rails_disk_service GET  /rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_key/*filename(.:format)                              active_storage/disk#show
update_rails_disk_service PUT  /rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_token(.:format)                                      active_storage/disk#update
     rails_direct_uploads POST /rails/active_storage/direct_uploads(.:format)                                           active_storage/direct_uploads#create
```

As I didn't intend to have any uploaded content in this app, I wanted to remove them. The [documentation](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) unfortunately doesn't mention much about these new routes. So I got digging through the rails core code & found a solution.

## How to remove these routes

In your `config/application.rb` file, find the line:

```ruby
    require 'rails/all'
```

And replace it with:

```ruby
require "rails"

# Include each railties manually, excluding `active_storage/engine`
require "active_model/railtie"
require "active_job/railtie"
require "active_record/railtie"
# require "active_storage/engine"
require "action_controller/railtie"
require "action_mailer/railtie"
require "action_view/railtie"
require "action_cable/engine"
require "sprockets/railtie"
require "rails/test_unit/railtie"
```

What this will do is instead of requiring [rails/all](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/all.rb), it'll just require the railties we're planning to use.

By removing `active_storage/engine`, the Active Storage railties is no longer required and the routes it requires are no longer mounted. üëç

### Undefined method `active_storage'

If you're running into an error that looks a little bit like:

```
NoMethodError: undefined method `active_storage' for #<Rails::Application::Configuration
```

You have a reference to ActiveStorage in one of your `config/application.rb` or `config/environments/*.rb` files which looks like:

```ruby
# Store uploaded files on the local file system (see config/storage.yml for options)
config.active_storage.service = :local
```

Remove that line and also the `config/storage.yml` if it is present, and you should be good to go.

### Skip adding ActiveStorage on new builds

If you're starting a new project and you'd like to skip having ActiveStorage be added from the get go, add the `--skip-active-storage` argument when you generate a new project. For example:

```bash
rails new AwesomeProject --skip-active-storage
```
