_TL;DR: Heroku is still hands downs my preferred choice for Rails hosting in 2020. Digital Ocean is my other preferred option._

Deploying modern web applications is one of the constant learning curves I've encountered over the last few years. Every solution is subtly different & it always feels like an ever evolving world.

I decided to experiment all the popular approaches over the last week & see what state of deployment was in 2020. For this I setup a simple Rails app which had the following fairly common requirements:

* Assets imported via Yarn
* Background jobs being performed via Sidekiq
* Database migrations to be run as part of deployment
* Easily scaleable
* Deployment can be automated after tests pass.
* Databases, Redis & file uploads are managed on an external service like AWS RDS & S3.

If they didn't offer a GitHub integration for deployment, I attempted to automated the deploy via Github Actions instead.

## Heroku

I've used Heroku as my go to solution for the last few years. For a while it had a repetition as being quite expensive, but now they have a tier which starts as $7 a month, which makes them very affordable.

Setting up my app was just a matter of connecting my account to the GitHub Repository & clicking "Deploy". Automating deploys was pretty painless as I just had a to check a box in their very clear web UI.

I liked that the pricing is fairly obvious. I could easily see how much I was spending & scale easily. The only drawback I've found is that Autoscaling is only available for the higher end tiers.

## Kubernetes on Digital Ocean

Every time I used Kubernetes on my local machine I had to give up 50% of my resources to get it running, so I've always been a little put off by it. However, it is a very popular choice for managing application resources on production servers.

Still trying this one out.

## Dokku

Dokku is kind of like Heroku, but if you wanted to run your app on a single server. It's pretty nice over using Capistrano on a single server as it handles a good amount of the extra configuration for you.

I liked how simple the [GitHub Action for Dokku Deploying](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dokku-to-deploy) looked, you're pretty much just pushing your code via git to your server & letting it do the rest.

It's a little unclear how Dokku will scale once you reach the limitation of your server (Other then increasing your single servers resources), but it does seem quite suitable for solo side projects.

## Capistrano + Virtual Private Server

I've had a few side projects that I had running on AWS Lightsail which I deployed with Capistrano in the past. It's super nice to run when you only want to run a Rails app for less than $5 a month. There are even [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/capistrano-deploy) to automate deployments.

I don't use Capistrano to often any more as it requires setting up & _maintaining_ of servers. I really discourage developers from burdening themselves with server administration, as it's a large time sink which can be avoided by using a platform which removes this need.

## Cloud 66

I used Cloud 66 in the past (Both their Maestro & classic Ruby on Rails offerings). It's a nice service & being able to connect a codebase, the just deploy it out to your AWS account is enjoyable.

Their classic Ruby on Rails offerings is pretty quick to get going with, but as you scale up in servers will start to feel expensive. I'm also a little sceptical what they do to maintain servers.

I'd suggest only using their Maestro product, as it's a bit like Convox, where they simplify Kubernetes into a single configuration file.

## Convox

Convox is a really nice concept. You connect your AWS, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud or Azure account & they'll manage a Kubernetes stack for you. Then you connect your GitHub Repository and they'll handle deployments, all configured via a simple [`convox.yml`](https://docs.convox.com/configuration/convox-yml) file.

It didn't take me to long to get an app up and running on AWS which was nice, however deploying the same app to Digital Ocean didn't quite work as smoothly. When I emailed their support enquiring what was wrong I didn't get a response.

I really wanted to recommend when I first started using it, but I think it needs more polish for me to recommend it as a solution for everyone.

## Google App Engine

Getting up and going was pretty straight forward. They had a fairly [clear guide](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/rails/using-cloudsql-postgres) to get going from my local terminal, which looked fairly easily to translate to a GitHub Action if I wanted to deploy in an automated fashion.

Out of the box the pricing was a little unclear (I had to use the [Google Cloud Platform Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to figure out the monthly cost). But once I started running some numbers it felt like it could very easily become quite expensive if I wasn't actively monitoring my application.

One disappointing drawback was managing Environment Variables. If I wanted to store any API keys, I had to commit them to version control or [inject them while deploying](https://dev.to/mungell/google-cloud-app-engine-environment-variables-5990). I only scratched the surface, so there might be a better solution out there, but I couldn't find it.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

I've deployed a few apps via Beanstalk is the past & it's not to bad, though the UI does feel very "AWS" in the sense of it throws a wall of information at you & if you're not familiar with AWS it can feel a little overwhelming.

One aspected I struggled to setup easily was the background worker. It kind of feels like it's not made for running background services like Sidekiq. I'm sure it's possible, but when it's so easy on other services this was a little disappointing.

## Azure App Service

I was quite impressed by Azure, it had a UI which made getting setting fairly easy. Out of the box it didn't support Ruby, but if you're using Docker this isn't an issue. I also found a [Github Actions template](https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/blob/master/AppService/docker-webapp-container-on-azure.yml) for deploying which was nice.

Like Google App Engine running migrations around the deploy process wasn't the most obvious thing to setup. When searching for the best way to solve this issue, I kept finding results for the "App Service Migration Assistant" which made finding information about database migrations somewhat tricky.
