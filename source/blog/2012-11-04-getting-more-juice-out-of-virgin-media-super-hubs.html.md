I've recently moved to my ISP over to Virgin Media, the download speed is pretty decent but the no-so-super hub they provide is pants. The super hub has terrible signal strength (standing 8m away from it lead to a 50% drop in download speed) & it regularly dropped out.

The only solution I could find online to get decent signal was to change the super hub into Modem Mode than attach a decent router. I decided on the [TP-Link TL-WR1043ND](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002YETVTQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B002YETVTQ&linkCode=as2&tag=fulondes-21)![](https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=fulondes-21&l=as2&o=2&a=B002YETVTQ) from Amazon (It's was £43 or so) & now my signal is almost 95% at the other side of my house with very little noticeable speed loss. If your on Virgin Media & have a spare £40 you should give it a try. Below is a picture of my setup.
