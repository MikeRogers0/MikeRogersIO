Rails 5.2 introduced support for [JSON field types](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_postgresql.html#json-and-jsonb), which is super awesome. It allows a really nice way of storing blobs of JSON against an object in your database. But while they're convenient, they can end up being a double edged sword and can lead to a headache if you aren't careful.

Here are two patterns I've seen popping up, which I think should be avoided.

## Merging JSON data

Imagine a scenario where you'd like to store some adhoc data against a model, so you merge the new data over the old data e.g:


```ruby
model = Model.find(params[:id])

# Set some values:
new_values = { important_value: :value }

# But in another HTTP request, at the same time you're running:
new_values = { other_important: :value }

model.jsonb_field.merge!(new_values)
model.save
model.jsonb_field['important_value'] # Could be empty or out of date.
```

This is a really risky pattern, because in a multi-threaded environments (e.g. two HTTP requests updating the same object around the same time) you'll run the risk of losing data. This is because from the point `.find` is called, the model may have been updated from another request.

A better approach is to store data you _really want to be there_ in its own field. Most frameworks are smart enough to only update the fields you've changed (Rails included).

## A replacement for columns

A pattern I've seen pop up, is the JSON columns being used as an alternative to putting things in their own columns, e.g:

```ruby
user.settings = {
  dark_mode: true,
  send_weekly_digest: true,
  locale: 'en'
}
```

This is usually done in an attempt to normalise data to avoid N+1 queries, which is good & gems such as [activerecord-typedstore](https://github.com/byroot/activerecord-typedstore) make this process fairly manageable.

However, I've found querying against this data can be unreliable, e.g.

```ruby
 User.where("settings @> ?", { dark_mode: true }.to_json) }
 ```

If the event the User model hadn't been saved since a new field in the JSON was added, this could return in incorrect number.

A better approach would be to add a migration for a field called `settings_dark_mode` with a default of `true` or `false`. While visually not as lovely, it does make for more reliable querying.
