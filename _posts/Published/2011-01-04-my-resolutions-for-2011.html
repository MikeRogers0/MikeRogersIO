<p>Here are a few of my resolutions for 2011, hopefully if I remember I'll try to tick them off throughout the year.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Learn Ruby on Rails. I've wanted to learn RoR for a while now, but I've had the need. However, RoR is gaining a lot of popularity among clients. Another need reason to learn it is <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>, a really neat web publishing system which is much suitable for small business websites.</li>
	<li>Contribute more to GitHub and Google Code projects. I'm sure working on small projects semi regularly will benefit my coding skills and help with some cool stuff.</li>
	<li>Blog more. I'm hoping for about a post a week, maybe not entirely about programming but still geeky.</li>
	<li>Get an Android App into the market. I've been playing around with android for a while; it would be nice to make something which I feel is market worthy.</li>
	<li>Exercise more, without joining a gym.</li>
	<li>Use Linux more. I love Linux, but due to MS Word, Photoshop and games not running well under Wine I keep ending up back on Windows. I might also try and get a Mac at some point, but that's more of a "Could have" then a "Must have".</li>
	<li>Stop using YouTube &amp; other websites which annoy me. A handful of websites are making small changes which are bugging me, in 2011 I'm going to stop using websites which appear to be trolling me.</li>
	<li>Design More. I suck at designing, and a little practise would go a long way.</li>
</ul>
